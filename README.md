  In index.js lines 75-78 and lines 84-87 i used chatgbt to help make the sql code run properly. 

  in the querys.js chatgbt helped me to be able to find the corresponding response to the server. I was originally going to use a for loop and loop over every response to find the matching variable but i was having issues with that and chatgbt told me about .find and its syntax and i personally thought it made the code more readable and so i used that.
